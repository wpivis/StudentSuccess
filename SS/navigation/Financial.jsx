              Scholarships are merit-based or need-based financial awards given to students to support their education. They are typically provided by various organizations, 
              institutions, or individuals to students who meet specific criteria, such as academic achievements, athletic abilities, community involvement, or other talents. 
              You typically will have to maintain a certain GPA average and course enrollment load for all scholarships. Unlike loans, scholarships do not need to be repaid, 
              making them a valuable resource for students seeking financial support. The application process usually involves submitting essays, academic transcripts, and 
              other required documents.

              Pell Grant Scholarships

              <BodyText>
                The Federal Pell Grant is a need-based financial aid program provided by the U.S. Department of Education to support undergraduate students in their pursuit of 
                higher education. As the largest federal grant program for students, it aims to assist those from low-income backgrounds by helping them afford college or university 
                expenses. Eligibility for the Pell Grant is determined through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) process, which assesses the student's family 
                income, assets, and household size to calculate their expected family contribution (EFC). The lower the EFC, the higher the grant amount a student may receive. 
                The grant does not need to be repaid and can be used to cover various education-related costs such as tuition, fees, books, supplies, and living expenses. However, 
                the specific amount of the grant may vary from year to year based on financial circumstances and federal funding levels.

            <BracketedText>
              Grants are similar to scholarships in that they provide financial assistance to students. However, grants are typically need-based and awarded by federal or state 
              governments, educational institutions, or private organizations. They are often given to students from low-income families to help cover the cost of education. Like 
              scholarships, grants do not need to be repaid, making them an essential resource for students with financial constraints.
